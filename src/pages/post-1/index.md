Human-less Banks.   Last year, China’s second biggest state-owned China Construction Bank (CCB) opened a human-less bank in Shanghai. The automated tellers can perform services including account opening, gold investment, foreign exchange, money transfer and issuance of wealth management products.  In addition, the robots can also transfer money, change currency, open new bank accounts or make investments as human employees.

A significant portion of financial institution employees are required to act like robots. Executives and the employees know this fact.  Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan was quoted on CNBC " It's difficult to say where the market moves," he said, "but for the whole sector, it will be a lot of people [laid off] over the next five to 10 years”.

Market analysts will be more heavily measuring a bank’s success based off the profits per employee and revenue per employee ratios. Risk and compliance roles are being automated as we speak.  It’s also likely these major robotic and software automation initiatives won’t be rolled out full-scale until the next global recession occurs.  For your own edification type “automation” in any job search engine and see how many financial institutions come up looking for Automation Engineers, Automation Architects et cetera.

Bank of America ($BAC) opened around 50 human-less branches with the help of screens to communicate with associates from other branches when needed.  Eventually, the software will be sophisticated enough to manage most demands of customers without human help.  The software of the machine-learning tools will also "predict" the customer's desires.  The human-less branches are almost 75% smaller than conventional branches, further reducing $BAC's COGS.

Chase Bank used to annually need 360,000 employee hours to check and update 12,000 commercial agreements.  Chase developed a tool called COiN to do the same of work in seconds.  The Emerging Opportunities Engine was created to identify relevant clients for diluted and non-diluted follow-on equity offerings.  It's also being used in Equity Capital Markets (ECM) and in Debt Capital Markets (DCM). In addition, Chase is using natural language processing (NLP) to address the annual average of 1.7 million employee technology help desk requests.

Citi Ventures a subset of Citibank has made investments in several firms specializing in fraud detection to chatbots. Citi Ventures developed ProxymitySM, a proxy voting platform by directly connecting and authenticating issuers with investors while making shareholder voting more efficient, accurate and transparent.

$NDAQ and $C recently developed a payment solution that enables straight through payment processing (STP) and automates reconciliation by using a blockchain distributed ledger to record and transmit payment instructions. 
HSBC is collaborating with Softbank Robotics to have Pepper, a humanoid robot help you with your banking needs.
